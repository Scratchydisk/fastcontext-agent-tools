# Evaluation

This project currently has two evidence layers:

1. Local integration QA for this MCP server and Codex skill package.
2. Model-quality evidence from the upstream Microsoft FastContext project.

![Evaluation summary](assets/evaluation-summary.svg)

The summary image is intentionally split by data source and evidence type:

- Official Microsoft FastContext benchmark data.
- Local wrapper QA checks from this repository.
- Local before/after token smoke tests for MICE and FanPlan Android.

`FanPlan` is an anonymized local Android app fixture name used for reporting.

## Local Integration QA

The repeatable local check is:

```bash
python -m evaluation.run_wrapper_eval
```

Last checked result committed in `evaluation/wrapper-eval.json`:

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests | PASS | Runs 13 tests covering parser, runtime, server, and wrapper behavior |
| MCP initialize | PASS | Starts the stdio server and completes JSON-RPC `initialize` |
| MCP tool discovery | PASS | Verifies `tools/list` exposes `fastcontext_health`, `fastcontext_explore`, and `fastcontext_explore_with_trace` |
| Health uses bundled CLI | PASS | Verifies `fastcontext_health` reports `fastcontext_mcp.fastcontext_cli` as the command module |
| Citation parsing | PASS | Runs `fastcontext_explore` through a fake FastContext CLI and parses two file-line citations |
| Trace output | PASS | Runs `fastcontext_explore_with_trace` and verifies the trajectory file is written inside the repo |
| Path allowlist guard | PASS | Calls a repo outside `FASTCONTEXT_ALLOWED_ROOTS` and verifies it is rejected |

Scope:

- MCP protocol basics: `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
- Tool contract: `fastcontext_health`, `fastcontext_explore`, and `fastcontext_explore_with_trace`.
- Citation parsing from a FastContext-style `<final_answer>` block.
- Read-safety guard through `FASTCONTEXT_ALLOWED_ROOTS`.
- Trace file creation when `trajectory_path` is supplied.

Limitation:

- This wrapper evaluation uses a fake `fastcontext.cli` package so it can run without a GPU or model endpoint.
- It proves the integration wrapper, not FastContext model quality or before/after task impact.

## Local Before/After Token Smoke Tests

Two local before/after token smoke tests are committed:

- `evaluation/local-before-after-results.json` for the latest aggregate run
- `evaluation/mice-checkin-before-after.json`
- `evaluation/fanplan-fcm-before-after.json`

Token measurement uses `tiktoken` `cl100k_base` as a consistent local estimator
for main-agent context. It does not include FastContext's internal endpoint
tokens.

### MICE Check-In Endpoint

Question:

> Locate the central check-in verification endpoint that writes Log records,
> marks tickets as used, updates subTickets, and may enqueue Printer jobs.

Project under test:

```text
/Users/jakevinlo/project/NodeProject/mice-gcloud-version
```

Ground truth:

- `app/routers/logs.js`
- `POST /log/add`
- Relevant lines include `192`, `233`, `275`, `304`, and `340`.

| Condition | Main-agent context tokens | Correctly found ground truth? | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Direct exploration | 7,039 | Yes | Search task symbols, then read `app/routers/logs.js:192-360` |
| FastContext raw output | 198 | No | Returned dashboard citations, but missed `app/routers/logs.js` |
| FastContext cited-file verification plus fallback | 10,910 | Yes | Had to read incorrect citations, then fall back; +55.0% tokens versus direct |

For this local task, FastContext did not produce a token win when correctness is
required. The raw response was short, but the missed citation forced fallback.

### FanPlan Android FCM

Question:

> Locate where FCM push notifications are received in the Android app, how
> `RemoteMessage` data is parsed into `NotificationEntity`, and where the
> Firebase messaging service is registered in the manifest.

Project under test:

```text
/path/to/FanPlan_Android
```

The local source path and package names are anonymized in this public artifact.

Ground truth:

- `android/app/src/main/java/com/company/fanplan/android/FanPlanFirebaseMessagingService.kt`
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

| Condition | Main-agent context tokens | Correctly found ground truth? | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Direct exploration | 2,279 | Yes | Search FCM symbols, then read service and manifest ranges |
| FastContext raw output | 81 | No | Cited nonexistent FanPlan paths |
| FastContext cited-file verification plus fallback | 2,360 | Yes | No cited file could be read, then fallback; +3.6% tokens versus direct |

For this local task, FastContext again returned a short answer but did not
produce a correct localization without fallback.

## Local Query-Variant Matrix

A repeatable matrix run is committed in
`evaluation/local-query-matrix-results.json`. It uses the same MICE check-in
task with three query styles and two repeats per style:

| Variant | Runs | Ground-truth hits | Best successful token delta | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `natural` | 2 | 0 | n/a | Returned a wrong script citation once and no final answer once |
| `symbol_guided` | 2 | 0 | n/a | Drifted to a wrong nested app path once and no final answer once |
| `official_style` | 2 | 0 | n/a | Returned frontend/script citations once and timed out once |

The matrix did not reproduce the official token gains. The local endpoint used
`fastcontext-tools-64k:latest`; Microsoft documents the official 4B explorer as
`microsoft/FastContext-1.0-4B-SFT` served with SGLang, `qwen` tool-call parsing,
and 262K context.

## Endpoint Readiness

`evaluation/local-endpoint-readiness.json` captures the current local
`/v1/models` response after passing it through `evaluation.endpoint_readiness`.
The current result is not official-ready:

- Observed model: `fastcontext-tools-64k:latest`
- Required official model: `microsoft/FastContext-1.0-4B-SFT`
- Missing requirement: the official FastContext model is not exposed by
  `/v1/models`
- Serving notes to match before claiming official parity: SGLang serving,
  `qwen` tool-call parser, and 262K context length

## Official Serving Preflight

`evaluation/local-official-serving-preflight.json` captures the local runtime
state after combining the endpoint readiness artifact with local environment
checks. The current result is not official-ready:

- Endpoint readiness: `false`
- Observed model: `fastcontext-tools-64k:latest`
- Runtime blocker: SGLang is not installed in the project Python environment
- Runtime blocker: CUDA/NVIDIA serving runtime is not available locally
- Platform observed by the project environment: Darwin arm64

This preflight does not claim that FastContext cannot run elsewhere. It records
that this local project environment is not the official-style serving setup used
for Microsoft's published benchmark claims.

## Official Benchmark Readiness

`evaluation/local-official-benchmark-readiness.json` captures whether the local
workspace is ready to run the official Microsoft benchmark surfaces documented
upstream:

- End-to-end Mini-SWE-Agent SWE-bench runner:
  `benchmark/evaluation/bench_mini_swe_agent.py`
- Standalone FastContext exploration runner:
  `benchmark/swebench/bench_fastcontext.py`
- Citation scorer:
  `benchmark/evaluation/run_score.py`

The current result is not ready:

- Official upstream checkout: present at commit
  `936c0052f19b0936be51a24f8a76cfe2c47580e6`
- Required upstream files and built wheel: present
- Official benchmark `.env`: present, but still uses placeholder credentials
- Main-agent credential: not usable yet
- Official serving preflight: `false`
- Local tools available: `uv=true`, `docker=true`, `docker_daemon=true`
- Official benchmark CLI probes: `bench_mini_swe_agent.py --help`,
  `bench_fastcontext.py --help`, and `run_score.py` import-only check all pass

This check is stricter than the local smoke tests. It records whether this
machine can run Microsoft's benchmark commands, not whether this MCP wrapper's
own tests pass.

### Re-Running

The repeatable harness is:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m evaluation.token_benchmark evaluation/token-benchmark-tasks.json --output evaluation/local-before-after-results.json
```

For the query-variant matrix:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m evaluation.token_benchmark evaluation/token-benchmark-matrix-tasks.json --matrix --repeats 2 --output evaluation/local-query-matrix-results.json
```

For the endpoint readiness artifact:

```bash
curl -sS "$BASE_URL/models" | uv run python -m evaluation.endpoint_readiness - --output evaluation/local-endpoint-readiness.json
```

For the official-serving preflight artifact:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.official_serving_preflight --endpoint-readiness evaluation/local-endpoint-readiness.json --output evaluation/local-official-serving-preflight.json
```

For the official benchmark readiness artifact:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.official_benchmark_readiness \
  --upstream-root /absolute/path/to/microsoft/fastcontext \
  --config /absolute/path/to/microsoft/fastcontext/.env \
  --serving-preflight evaluation/local-official-serving-preflight.json \
  --output evaluation/local-official-benchmark-readiness.json \
  --probe-commands
```

The benchmark requires a FastContext-compatible endpoint and `tiktoken`.
The FanPlan task uses anonymized paths in the committed task file; replace
`/path/to/FanPlan_Android` with a local fixture path before re-running it.

A broader local benchmark should compare the same coding tasks under two
conditions:

- Direct exploration: the main agent reads and searches the repository itself.
- FastContext-delegated exploration: the main agent asks FastContext for
  candidate file-line citations, then solves from that focused evidence.

Both conditions need the same main agent, same endpoint configuration, same task
set, and measured outcomes such as task success, main-agent tokens, wall time,
and cited-file precision.

## Upstream Model Evidence

The model-quality claims should be attributed to Microsoft FastContext:

- Project: <https://github.com/microsoft/fastcontext>
- Model card: <https://huggingface.co/microsoft/FastContext-1.0-4B-SFT>
- Paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.14066>

Microsoft reports that FastContext is a lightweight repository-exploration subagent using read-only `READ`, `GLOB`, and `GREP` tools, returning compact file-line citations. Their reported Mini-SWE-Agent integration results include up to 5.5 score improvement and up to 60.3% main-agent token reduction across SWE-bench Multilingual, SWE-bench Pro, and SWE-QA.

This repository does not re-run those benchmarks. Reproducing them requires the upstream benchmark harness, task datasets, and configured main-agent and FastContext model endpoints.
